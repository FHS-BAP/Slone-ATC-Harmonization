The Slone Drug Dictionaryâ„¢ is a computerized coding system utilized in epidemiological studies to collect and analyze drug data. It simplifies the coding of medication names for analysis purposes. This dictionary has been employed by the Slone Epidemiology Center and various organizations since the 1970s, offering a proven tool for analyzing drug exposure and utilization information. It covers prescription and non-prescription drugs, dietary supplements, and their active ingredients, allowing researchers to easily identify specific groups of exposures. The program scripts can be used to harmonize the Slone Drug Dictionary with Framingham ATC Medication codes for broader utilization across NIH-funded projects.
